# Practwist CT2
A speedrun practice mod for JP Chameleon Twist 2 that adds save states and a crash screen

# How to patch
Take a vanilla chameleon twist 2 jp rom in `.z64 format` and patch it using the `.bps` file at this site https://hack64.net/tools/patcher.php</br></br>
If you rom isn't `.z64` format, this site can swap it to that format https://hack64.net/tools/swapper.php

# Controls
Currently, only one savestate slot exist (and is uncompressed so it's very fast)</br>
`dpad-left` saves the state, `dpad-right` loads the state</br>
`R + dpad-down` toggles the menu to open/close</br>
Dpad-left and Dpad-right scrolls the pages in the menu, `A` toggles the option</br></br>

`Start + A` opens the original devs debug menu</br>
This can be used to pick a stage to load into with dpad left/right, and pressing A on the stage wanted</br>
